<h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>
<p>Accurate retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis (LNM) prediction in early-stage testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) harbours the potential to significantly reduce over- or undertreatment and treatment-related morbidity in this group of young patients as an important survivorship imperative. We investigated the role of computed tomography (CT) radiomics models integrating clinical predictors for the individualized prediction of LNM in early-stage TGCT. Ninety-one patients with surgically proven testicular germ cell tumours and contrast-enhanced CT were included in this retrospective study. Dedicated radiomics software was used to segment 273 retroperitoneal lymph nodes and extract features. After feature selection, radiomics-based machine learning models were developed to predict LN metastasis. The robustness of the procedure was controlled by 10-fold cross-validation. Using multivariable logistic regression modelling, we developed three prediction models: A radiomics-only model, a clinical-only model and a combined radiomics-clinical model. The models&rsquo; performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, decision curve analysis was performed to estimate the clinical usefulness of the predictive model. The radiomics-only model for predicting lymph node metastasis reached a greater discrimination power than the clinical-only model, with an AUC of 0.84 (± 0.17; 95% CI ) vs 0.60 (± 0.22; 95% CI) in our study cohort. The combined model integrating clinical risk factors and selected radiomics features outperformed the clinical-only and the radiomics-only prediction models and showed good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.94 ( ± 0.10; 95% CI). The decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical usefulness of our proposed combined model. The presented combined CT-based radiomics-clinical model represents an exciting non-invasive prediction tool for individualized prediction of LN metastasis in testicular germ cell tumours. Multi-centre validation is required to generate high-quality evidence for its clinical application.</p>

<h5 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h5>
<p>A major obstacle to the learning-based segmentation of healthy and tumorous brain tissue is the requirement of having to create a fully labeled training dataset. Obtaining these data requires tedious and error-prone manual labeling with respect to both tumor and non-tumor areas. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new method to obtain high-quality classifiers from a dataset with only small parts of labeled tumor areas. This is achieved by using positive and unlabeled learning in conjunction with a domain adaptation technique. The proposed approach leverages the tumor volume, and we show that it can be either derived with simple measures or completely automatic with a proposed estimation method. While learning from sparse samples allows reducing the necessary annotation time from 4 h to 5 min, we show that the proposed approach further reduces the necessary annotation by roughly 50% while maintaining comparative accuracies compared to traditionally trained classifiers with this approach.</p>

<h5 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h5>
<p>Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoid malignancy with a poor prognosis characterised by frequent relapse and short durations of treatment response. Most patients present with aggressive disease, but there exist indolent subtypes without the need for immediate intervention. The very heterogeneous behaviour of MCL is genetically characterised by the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression with distinct clinical and biological characteristics and outcomes. There is still an unfulfilled need for precise MCL prognostication in real-time. Machine learning and deep learning neural networks are rapidly advancing technologies with promising results in numerous fields of application. This study develops and compares the performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms and radiomics-based machine learning (ML) models to predict MCL relapse on baseline CT scans. Five classification algorithms were used, including three deep learning models (3D SEResNet50, 3D DenseNet, and an optimised 3D CNN) and two machine learning models based on K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). The best performing method, our optimised 3D CNN, predicted MCL relapse with a 70% accuracy, better than the 3D SEResNet50 (62%) and the 3D DenseNet (59%). The second-best performing method was the KNN-based machine learning model (64%) after principal component analysis for improved accuracy. Our optimised CNN developed by ourselves correctly predicted MCL relapse in 70% of the patients on baseline CT imaging. Once prospectively tested in clinical trials with a larger sample size, our proposed 3D deep learning model could facilitate clinical management by precision imaging in MCL.</p>

<h5 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h5>
<p>The study’s primary aim is to evaluate the predictive performance of CT-derived 3D radiomics for MCL risk stratification. The secondary objective is to search for radiomic features associated with sustained remission. Included were 70 patients: 31 MCL patients and 39 control subjects with normal axillary lymph nodes followed over five years. Radiomic analysis of all targets (n = 745) was performed and features selected using the Mann Whitney U test; the discriminative power of identifying “high-risk MCL” was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The four radiomic features, “Uniformity”, “Entropy”, “Skewness” and “Difference Entropy” showed predictive significance for relapse (p &lt; 0.05)—in contrast to the routine size measurements, which showed no relevant difference. The best prognostication for relapse achieved the feature “Uniformity” (AUC-ROC-curve 0.87; optimal cut-off ≤0.0159 to predict relapse with 87% sensitivity, 65% specificity, 69% accuracy). Several radiomic features, including the parameter “Short Axis,” were associated with sustained remission. CT-derived 3D radiomics improves the predictive estimation of MCL patients; in combination with the ability to identify potential radiomic features that are characteristic for sustained remission, it may assist physicians in the clinical management of MCL.</p>

<h5 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h5>
<p>Automated vehicles need to not only perceive their environment, but also predict the possible future behavior of all detected traffic participants in order to safely navigate in complex scenarios and avoid critical situations, ranging from merging on highways to crossing urban intersections. Due to the availability of datasets with large numbers of recorded trajectories of traffic participants, deep learning based approaches can be used to model the behavior of road users. This paper proposes a convolutional network that operates on rasterized actor-centric images which encode the static and dynamic actor-environment. We predict multiple possible future trajectories for each traffic actor, which include position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, yaw rate and position uncertainty estimates. To make better use of the past movement of the actor, we propose to employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and rely on uncertainties estimated from the previous object tracking stage. We evaluate our approach on the public &ldquo;Argoverse Motion Forecasting&rdquo; dataset, on which it won the first prize at the Argoverse Motion Forecasting Challenge, as presented on the NeurIPS 2019 workshop on &ldquo;Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving&rdquo;.</p>
